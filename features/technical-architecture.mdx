## Smart Wallet Abstractions

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="ERC-4337 Compatibility"
    icon="wallet"
  >
    Allows for meta-transactions and custom transaction rules (like gas sponsorship).
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Agent-Specific Wallets"
    icon="shield-halved"
  >
    Each agent has a dedicated wallet address, isolating risks and ensuring user-controlled budgets.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Granular Permissions"
    icon="key"
  >
    Users can define max-spend amounts, transaction frequency, or whitelisted tokens to prevent misuse.

## Plugin System

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Composable Modules"
    icon="puzzle-piece"
  >
    Each plugin addresses a specific function—swapping on a DEX, pulling price data, minting NFTs, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="External Oracles"
    icon="satellite-dish"
  >
    Price feeds, weather data, social media APIs, chain analytics—accessible through standardized interfaces.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Plugin Manager"
    icon="cubes"

## AI & ML Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Language Models">
    GPT-based or similarly advanced LLMs can parse instructions, generate code snippets, and adapt logic based on real-time data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom ML Inferences">
    Agents can plug into specialized models (e.g., sentiment analysis for crypto Twitter, anomaly detection for wallet transactions).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Pipeline">
    A robust pipeline that fetches, normalizes, and caches external data before passing it to AI models for decision-making.
  </Step>
</Steps>
