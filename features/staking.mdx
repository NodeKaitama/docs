title: 'Staking & Revenue Sharing'
description: 'A model designed to align incentives for all participants in the Sentio ecosystem through token staking and fee distribution.'
---

## Overview

<Note>
  By locking up SEN tokens, stakers can earn a portion of the fees generated across the platform, including agent usage fees, subscription charges, and other revenue streams. This approach fosters a mutually beneficial environment where token holders share in Sentio's success and provide valuable support to the network's security and liquidity.
</Note>

## How Staking Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locking Up SEN">
    1. Users transfer SEN tokens from their personal wallets to a staking smart contract
    2. The contract securely holds their tokens for a chosen lock-up period
    3. Lock-up periods can be 30 days, 90 days, or custom durations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earning Platform Fees">
    1. AI agent transactions, subscriptions, and other revenue sources contribute to a stake reward pool
    2. Stakers receive regular distributions proportional to their staked amount and lock-up duration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock-Up & Unstaking">
    1. Longer lock-up periods earn higher reward multipliers
    2. After the lock-up period or unstaking request, users can withdraw tokens plus unclaimed rewards
  </Step>
</Steps>
