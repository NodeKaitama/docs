## Tokenization Process

### Step 1: Create a Powerful Agent

Start by leveraging Sentio's no-code builder to design an autonomous agent tailored to your specific needs. Whether it's sniping AI-based memecoins, executing cross-chain arbitrage, or launching tokens based on influential events (like Elon Musk's tweets), Sentio enables you to deploy agents that run 24/7, handling complex tasks and generating revenue through on-chain transaction fees.

### Step 2: Launch a Token for Your Agent

Once your agent proves its effectiveness and starts generating consistent revenue, you can tokenize it to share its earnings with a broader community. Here's a step-by-step guide to launching your agent's token:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish Your Automation">
    - Deploy and Validate: Ensure your agent is fully operational and generating revenue through its designated tasks.
    - Market Presence: List your agent on Sentio's Agent Marketplace, making it accessible for others to use and benefit from its automation capabilities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Launch Requirements">
    To tokenize your agent and initiate revenue sharing, you need to meet the following prerequisites:
    - 30,000 SEN Tokens: Demonstrates your commitment to the Sentio ecosystem
    - Ethereum (ETH): Required for liquidity provisioning and token launch processes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Liquidity to SEN LP">
    - Locking SEN and ETH:
      - 30,000 SEN and a portion of your ETH are added to the SEN token Liquidity Pool (LP)
      - This liquidity is locked for 6 months, ensuring stability and trust within the ecosystem
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Liquidity for the Agent's Token">
    - New Token Contract:
      - Use the remaining ETH to add liquidity to the new token contract specific to your agent
      - This establishes a stable trading environment for your agent's token, encouraging investor confidence and participation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Share Revenue with Token Holders

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Revenue Distribution" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    - A percentage of the revenue generated from your agent's on-chain transaction fees is distributed to SEN and GPU stakers
    - This incentivizes token holders to support and invest in your agent's success
  </Card>
  <Card title="Earning Opportunities" icon="coins">
    - Token Holders: Earn a share of the agent's revenue simply by holding its token
    - Community Growth: Encourages wider participation and investment, fostering a collaborative and prosperous ecosystem
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Benefits of Tokenizing Your Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monetization">
    Transform your agent into a tradable asset, earning revenue not only from its performance but also from token appreciation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Community Engagement">
    Foster a loyal community invested in the agent's success through shared revenue streams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scalability">
    Utilize community funds to enhance and expand your agent's capabilities, driving further innovation and performance.
  </Step>
</Steps>
